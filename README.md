# Running Apache Spark jobs on AKS

[Apache Spark][apache-spark] is a fast engine for large-scale data processing. As of the [Spark 2.3.0 release][spark-latest-release], Apache Spark supports native integration with Kubernetes clusters. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes environment running in Azure. This document details preparing and running Apache Spark jobs on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete the steps within this article, you need the following.

* Basic understanding of Kubernetes and [Apache Spark][spark-quickstart].
* [Docker Hub][docker-hub] account, or an [Azure Container Registry][acr-create].
* Azure CLI [installed][azure-cli] on your development system.
* [JDK 8][java-install] installed on your system.
* SBT ([Scala Build Tool][sbt-install]) installed on your system.
* Git command-line tools installed on your system.

## Create an AKS cluster

Spark is used for large-scale data processing and requires that Kubernetes nodes are sized to meet the Spark resources requirements. We recommend a minimum size of `Standard_D3_v2` for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.

If you need an AKS cluster that meets this minimum recommendation, run the following commands.

Create a resource group for the cluster.

```azurecli
az group create --name mySparkCluster --location eastus
```

Create the AKS cluster with nodes that are of size `Standard_D3_v2`.

```azurecli
az aks create --resource-group mySparkCluster --name mySparkCluster --node-vm-size Standard_D3_v2
```

Connect to the AKS cluster.

```azurecli
az aks get-credentials --resource-group mySparkCluster --name mySparkCluster
```

If you are using Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store container images, configure authentication between AKS and ACR. See the [ACR authentication documentation][acr-aks] for these steps.

## Build the Spark source

Before running Spark jobs on an AKS cluster, you need to build the Spark source code and package it into a container image. The Spark source includes scripts that can be used to complete this process.

Clone the Spark project repository to your development system.

```bash
git clone -b branch-2.3 https://github.com/apache/spark
```

Change into the directory of the cloned repository and save the path of the Spark source to a variable.

```bash
cd spark
sparkdir=$(pwd)
```

If you have multiple JDK versions installed, set `JAVA_HOME` to use version 8 for the current session.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -d 64 -v "1.8*"`
```

Run the following command to build the Spark source code with Kubernetes support.

```bash
./build/mvn -Pkubernetes -DskipTests clean package
```

The following commands create the Spark container image and push it to a container image registry. Replace `registry.example.com` with the name of your container registry and `v1` with the tag you prefer to use. If using Docker Hub, this value is the registry name. If using Azure Container Registry (ACR), this value is the ACR login server name.

```bash
REGISTRY_NAME=registry.example.com
REGISTRY_TAG=v1
```

```bash
./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r $REGISTRY_NAME -t $REGISTRY_TAG build
```

Push the container image to your container image registry.

```bash
./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r $REGISTRY_NAME -t $REGISTRY_TAG push
```

## Prepare a Spark job

Next, prepare a Spark job. A jar file is used to hold the Spark job and is needed when running the `spark-submit` command. The jar can be made accessible through a public URL or pre-packaged within a container image. In this example, a sample jar is created to calculate the value of Pi. This jar is then uploaded to Azure storage. If you have an existing jar, feel free to substitute

Create a directory where you would like to create the project for a Spark job.

```bash
mkdir myprojects
cd myprojects
```

Create a new Scala project from a template.

```bash
sbt new sbt/scala-seed.g8
```

When prompted, enter `SparkPi` for the project name.

```bash
name [Scala Seed Project]: SparkPi
```

Navigate to the newly created project directory.

```bash
cd sparkpi
```

Run the following commands to add an SBT plugin, which allows packaging the project as a jar file.

```bash
touch project/assembly.sbt
echo 'addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.6")' >> project/assembly.sbt
```

Run these commands to copy the sample code into the newly created project and add all necessary dependencies.

```bash
EXAMPLESDIR="src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples"
mkdir -p $EXAMPLESDIR
cp $sparkdir/examples/$EXAMPLESDIR/SparkPi.scala $EXAMPLESDIR/SparkPi.scala

cat <<EOT >> build.sbt
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.spark/spark-sql
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % "2.3.0" % "provided"
EOT

sed -ie 's/scalaVersion.*/scalaVersion := "2.11.11",/' build.sbt
sed -ie 's/name.*/name := "SparkPi",/' build.sbt
```

To package the project into a jar, run the following command.

```bash
sbt assembly
```

After successful packaging, you should see output similar to the following.

```bash
[info] Packaging /Users/me/myprojects/sparkpi/target/scala-2.11/SparkPi-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ...
[info] Done packaging.
[success] Total time: 10 s, completed Mar 6, 2018 11:07:54 AM
```

## Copy job to storage

Create an Azure storage account and container to hold the jar file.

```azurecli
RESOURCE_GROUP=sparkdemo
STORAGE_ACCT=sparkdemo$RANDOM
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location eastus
az storage account create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $STORAGE_ACCT --sku Standard_LRS
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=`az storage account show-connection-string --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $STORAGE_ACCT -o tsv`
```

Upload the jar file to the Azure storage account with the following commands.

```bash
CONTAINER_NAME=jars
BLOB_NAME=SparkPi-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
FILE_TO_UPLOAD=target/scala-2.11/SparkPi-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

echo "Creating the container..."
az storage container create --name $CONTAINER_NAME
az storage container set-permission --name $CONTAINER_NAME --public-access blob

echo "Uploading the file..."
az storage blob upload --container-name $CONTAINER_NAME --file $FILE_TO_UPLOAD --name $BLOB_NAME

jarUrl=$(az storage blob url --container-name $CONTAINER_NAME --name $BLOB_NAME | tr -d '"')
```

Variable `jarUrl` now contains the publicly accessible path to the jar file.

## Submit a Spark job

Start kube-proxy in a separate command-line with the following code.

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

Navigate back to the root of Spark repository.

```bash
cd $sparkdir
```

Submit the job using `spark-submit`.

```bash
./bin/spark-submit \
  --master k8s://http://127.0.0.1:8001 \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name spark-pi \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --conf spark.executor.instances=3 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=$REGISTRY_NAME/spark:$REGISTRY_TAG \
  $jarUrl
```

This operation starts the Spark job, which streams job status to your shell session. While the job is running, you can see Spark driver pod and executor pods using the kubectl get pods command. Open a second terminal session to run these commands.

```console
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                                               READY     STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
spark-pi-2232778d0f663768ab27edc35cb73040-driver   1/1       Running    0          16s
spark-pi-2232778d0f663768ab27edc35cb73040-exec-1   0/1       Init:0/1   0          4s
spark-pi-2232778d0f663768ab27edc35cb73040-exec-2   0/1       Init:0/1   0          4s
spark-pi-2232778d0f663768ab27edc35cb73040-exec-3   0/1       Init:0/1   0          4s
```

While the job is running, you can also access the Spark UI. In the second terminal session, use the `kubectl port-forward` command provide access to Spark UI.

```bash
kubectl port-forward spark-pi-2232778d0f663768ab27edc35cb73040-driver 4040:4040
```

To access Spark UI, open the address `127.0.0.1:4040` in a browser.

## Get job results and logs

After the job has finished, the driver pod will be in a "Completed" state. Get the name of the pod with the following command.

```bash
kubectl get pods --show-all
```

Output:

```bash
NAME                                               READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
spark-pi-2232778d0f663768ab27edc35cb73040-driver   0/1       Completed   0          1m
```

Use the `kubectl logs` command to get logs from the spark driver pod. Replace the pod name with your driver pod's name.

```bash
kubectl logs spark-pi-2232778d0f663768ab27edc35cb73040-driver
```

Within these logs, you can see the result of the Spark job, which is the value of Pi.

```bash
Pi is roughly 3.152155760778804
```

## Package jar with container image

In the above example, the Spark jar file was uploaded to Azure storage. Another option is to package the jar file into custom-built Docker images.

To do so, find the `dockerfile` for the Spark image located at `$sparkdir/resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/` directory. Add am `ADD` statement for the Spark job `jar` somewhere between `WORKDIR` and `ENTRYPOINT` declarations.

Update the jar path to the location of the `SparkPi-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file on your development system. You can also use your own custom jar file.

```bash
WORKDIR /opt/spark/work-dir

ADD /path/to/SparkPi-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar SparkPi-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

ENTRYPOINT [ "/opt/entrypoint.sh" ]
```

Build and push the image with the included Spark scripts.

```bash
./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r <your container repository name> -t <tag> build
./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r <your container repository name> -t <tag> push
```

When running the job, instead of indicating a remote jar URL, the `local://` scheme can be used with the path to the jar file in the Docker image.

```bash
./bin/spark-submit \
    --master k8s://https://<k8s-apiserver-host>:<k8s-apiserver-port> \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --name spark-pi \
    --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
    --conf spark.executor.instances=3 \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=<spark-image> \
    local:///opt/spark/work-dir/<your-jar-name>.jar
```
